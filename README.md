## About assigment 1
The repository contains my implementation to the functions in the header files Matrix.h, ErrorCode.h.
Those files implement the general behavior of a matrix: actions like getting a value in the place (i,j), adding two matrices, multiplying two matrices, and more.  
The implementation of a matrix is by using a 2D array, that will be with the sizes of the matrix.
Tests: the tests I have checked the code with, are the given main.c tester, and another test that I wrote,
that checkes things like adding and multiplying two matrices, and also prints the matrices to check if the actions actually worked.
