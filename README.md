# Matrix Library
**General Description:**  
This project is about a matrix library implementation.
The matrix library contains implementations the general behavior of a matrix: actions like getting a value in the place (i,j), adding two matrices, multiplying two matrices, and more. The matrix is implemented and saved in the memory as a flat array, that will be with the size of the matrix.  
The files can be compiled into a shared object file called libmatrix.so using the Cmake.  

**Tests:**  
The code has been tested with the main.c tester, and has passed it successfully.
