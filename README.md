# About assigment 1
The C files i have implemented are implementations to the functions in the header files 
Matrix.h, ErrorCode.h.                                                                                    Those files implement the general behavior of a matrix: actions like getting a value in the place (i,j), adding two matrices, multiplying two matrices, and more. 
The implementation of a matrix is by using a 2D array, that will be with the sizes of the matrix.

Tests: the tests i have checked the code with, are the given main.c tester, and another test that I wrote,
that checked things like adding and multiplying two matrices, and printing them to check if this is actually worked.
